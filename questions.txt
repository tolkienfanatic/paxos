1. The bottleneck of the implementation would be handling the requests. The microservice could be scaled by deploying
    multiple instances of the service behind a load balancer (of course there would be some extra work in making sure
    that the hashes are accessible globally)
2. n = Number of items in the price list.
    Parsing the file is O(n).
    find_pair is O(n^2) due to the nested loops - bad!
    find_pair2 is O(n) - much better.
    Overall = O(n)
3. X = Number of X's in the input string, n = length of input string
    replace_x() is O(2X) = O(X)
    valid_input() is O(n)
    Overall = O(X)
